This section examines the directory structure and files found in the Tomcat Servlet Container installation and how they relate to the TDS.

{%include note.html content="
This section assumes you have successfully installed the JDK and Tomcat Servlet Container as outlined in the [Installation of Java and Tomcat](install_java_tomcat.html) section.

## Exploring The Tomcat Directory Structure

Examine the Tomcat directory structure, a.k.a. `${tomcat_home}`.  Move into `${tomcat_home}` and do a long listing (`/usr/local` in this example):
    
~~~bash
# cd /usr/local/tomcat
# ls -l

Familiarize yourself with these important directories:

#### `bin/`

* Contains `startup.sh`, `shutdown.sh` and other scripts/programs.
* The `*.sh` files (for Unix and Mac OS systems) are functional duplicates of the `*.bat` files (for Windows systems).

#### `conf/`

* _Server-wide_ Tomcat configuration.
* You will modify `server.xml` and `tomcat-users.xml` to adjust logging, authentication and access control, enable TLS/SSL, etc.
* Web applications can override some server-wide settings in their own configuration file (e.g., the web deployment descriptor).

#### `webapps/`

* Contains web applications directories and WAR files.
* This is where we will be putting the TDS web application.
* You will also be using the `manager` application that comes with the Tomcat Servlet Container during this tutorial.

#### `logs/`

* Tomcat log files are here by default.
* This is one of the directories you will be looking for log files (the TDS logs elsewhere by default).
* The log files should be your first stop for troubleshooting Tomcat and TDS issues. (_Hint, hint_).
* Logs files may contain useful information for assessing the security of your system.
* Make a point of becoming familiar with the Tomcat-generated `catalina.out`, `catalina.yyyy-mm-dd.log`, and `localhost_access_log.yyyy-mm-dd.log` files.

## Next Step

Next, we'll look at starting/stopping the Tomcat Servlet Container as well as [configuring the JVM](running_tomcat.html) for the TDS.

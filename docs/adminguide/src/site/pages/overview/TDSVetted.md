## Is The TDS Stable And Secure?

The TDS is an [open-source project](https://github.com/Unidata/tds){:target="_blank"} and receives active development within the [Unidata Program Center](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/){:target="_blank"} and members of the Unidata community. 
It benefits from having multiple groups of people examining the code for defects.

All code contributed to the TDS undergoes [unit and integration testing](https://github.com/Unidata/tds/blob/master/.github/workflows/tds.yml){:target='_blank'} and security analysis detection to maintain code integrity.

When identified, any security-related issues are addressed immediately and fixed in a new release.

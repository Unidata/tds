## Using Tomcat And Apache HTTP Server

{%include note.html content="
The TDS reverse proxy using Apache has been tested and vetted by Unidata.  
Other HTTPD servers (e.g., NGINX) have not yet been explored.
" %}

Using Apache as a front-end proxy server for the TDS running on Tomcat is perhaps the easiest method for setting up a reverse proxy for the TDS. 
There are two methods to accomplish this:
  * Apache's `mod_proxy` in combination with Tomcat's HTTP connector; or
  * the `mod_jk` Apache module with the Tomcat AJP connector.
  
  {%include warning.html content="
  It is important to carefully configure your proxy so that the existence of the proxy is transparent to the end-user/client.
  For instance, when a web application (e.g., the TDS) on the backend server includes a self-referential URL in some response content, it should use the proxy server's name and port rather than those of the backend server.

## Implementing The Tomcat-Apache Proxy Using AJP

The following example shows how to implement a proxy using the Apache HTTPD server, Tomcat Servlet Container, and Tomcat's `mod_jk` on a linux system.

### Install `mod_jk`

1. [Download](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-connectors.cgi){:target="_blank"} the latest version of Tomcat's `mod_jk` module.

2. Build and install the `mod_jk` module as per the installation instructions that come bundled with the download.  The build and installation will need to be done as either `root`, `sudo`, or as user with privileges to modify Apache.
   
    ~~~bash
    # tar xvfz tomcat-connectors-1.2.xx-src.tar.gz
    # cd tomcat-connectors-1.2.xx-src/native
    # ./configure --with-apxs=/usr/bin/apxs  <--- path to your apache apxs
    # make
    # make install
    ~~~ 

    Confirm the module was added to the directory in which the Apache HTTPD server stores its modules (`/usr/local/apache/modules` in this example):
    
    ~~~bash
    # cd /usr/local/apache/modules
    # ls -l  mod_jk.so
    
    -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 1147204 Oct  8 12:34 mod_jk.so
    ~~~

### Configure Apache HTTP Server To Use `mod_jk` To Talk To Tomcat

1.  Update Apache configurations to use the `mod_jk` module.

    `mod_jk` was built as a [DSO module](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/current/dso.html){:target="_blank"}, therefore you will need to update your Apache configurations to enable this 3rd-party module:

    The following example shows adding `mod_jk` configurations to a Apache HTTPD 2.4 server built from source.  
    Modify the main Apache server configuration file (usually `httpd.conf`) in the following manner (in this example `/usr/local/apache/conf` is where the Apache configuration files are located):
   
    ~~~bash
    # cd /usr/local/apache/conf
    # vi http.conf
    ~~~
    
    Add the following configurations to enable the `mod_jk` module, restrict access to web application `WEB-INF` and `META-INF` directories, and tell Apache where to find the `workers.properties` file using the `JkWorkersFile` directive. 
    (The `worker.properties` file is discussed in more detail below.)
    
    ~~~xml
    # Third party modules
    LoadModule jk_module    modules/mod_jk.so
 
    <IfModule jk_module>
        JkWorkersFile "conf/workers.properties"
        JkShmFile "logs/mod_jk.shm"
        JkLogFile "logs/mod_jk.log"
        JkLogLevel warn
        #Tomcat Security Section
        <LocationMatch "/WEB-INF/">
            Require all denied
        </LocationMatch>
    
        <LocationMatch "/META-INF/">
            Require all denied
        </LocationMatch>
    </IfModule>
    ~~~

    {% include note.html content="
     Consult the Tomcat documentation for more information about the [`mod_jk`](https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/apache.html){:target='_blank'} directives.
    " %}

2. Create a [`workers.properties`](https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/workers.html){:target="_blank"} file.
 
   The `mod_jk` modules in the Apache HTTPD server uses the `workers.properties` file to relevant map requests to the TDS using Tomcat's AJP connector.  
   
   Use your favorite text editor to create a `workers.properties` file in the Apache configuration directory that you specified in the previous step using the `JkWorkersFile` directive:

    ~~~bash
    # cd /usr/local/apache/conf
    # vi http.conf
    ~~~

    Add the following configurations to the `workers.properties` module to define a `worker` that will handle communication between the Apache HTTPD server and Tomcat.  
     
    ~~~bash
    # workers.properties
    # To allow tomcat and apache to talk to each other.
    # needed by mod_jk
    
    # Define workers
    worker.list=worker1
    
    # Define workers using ajp13 protocol to forward requests to the Tomcat processes.
    worker.worker1.type=ajp13
    
    # TDS app
    # worker1 will talk to Tomcat listening on localhost at port 8009
    worker.worker1.host=localhost
    worker.worker1.port=8009
    ~~~

    {% include note.html content="
     Consult the Tomcat documentation for more information about the [workers.properties](https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/workers.html){:target='_blank'} file syntax and options.
    " %}

3. Configure your Apache host to send the appropriate requests to TDS via `mod_jk` and Tomcat AJP.
    
   You will use the `JkMount` directives that come with the `mod_jk` to specify/match which URL requests should be proxied to the TDS in the Tomcat Servlet Container.
   
   The following shows an example of configuring an Apache `VirtualHost` with the `JkMount` directives.  
   Note that these directives reference the `worker` configured in the `workers.properties` file in the previous step. 
   
   ~~~bash
   <VirtualHost IP_ADDRESS:PORT>
       ServerName thredds.unidata.ucar.edu 
       ...
       
       # Proxy requests to the TDS
       JkMount /thredds* worker1
       JkMount /thredds worker1
       # Proxy requests to the Manager App
       JkMount /manager* worker1
       JkMount /manager worker1
       
       ...
   </VirtualHost>
   ~~~

    {% include note.html content="
     Consult the Tomcat documentation for more information about the [`JKMount`](https://tomcat.apache.org/connectors-doc/reference/apache.html){:target='_blank'} directive.
    " %}


### Configure Tomcat and the TDS for the proxy

1. Modify the Tomcat `AJP Connector`

   In the `${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml` file, locate  the `AJP Connector` (uncommented and enabled by default) and add the following additional configuration to it:

   ~~~xml
   <!-- AJP 1.3 Connector on port 8009 -->
       <Connector port="8009" 
                  enableLookups="false"
                  useBodyEncodingForURI="true"
                  connectionTimeout="20000"
                  protocol="AJP/1.3" />
   ~~~

   {% include info.html content="
   Consult the Tomcat documentation for more information about the [AJP Connector](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/config/ajp.html){:target='_blank'} configuration options.
   " %}
  
2. Disable any active `Java HTTP/1.1 Connector` and the `SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector` Tomcat connectors.

   {%include important.html content="
   Only perform this step is you have enabled Apache to handle the SSL/TLS encryption for Tomcat and the TDS.
   " %}

   This will prevent direct communication to Tomcat via ports `8080` and `8443` ensuring the AJP proxy via Apache is the only HTTP method by which to access Tomcat and the TDS.

   Locate the `Java HTTP/1.1 Connector` listening on port `8080` and the active `SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector` listening on port `8443` and comment them out:
   
   ~~~xml
     <!--
       <Connector port="8080" 
                  protocol="HTTP/1.1"
                  connectionTimeout="20000"
                  redirectPort="8443" />
     -->
     ...
     <!--
       <Connector port="8443" 
                  protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" 
                  maxThreads="150" 
                  SSLEnabled="true">
          <SSLHostConfig>
              <Certificate certificateKeystoreFile="conf/localhost-rsa.jks" 
                           type="RSA" />
          </SSLHostConfig>
       </Connector>
      -->
   ~~~ 

3. Configure the TDS to relinquish control of TLS/SSL to Apache

   {%include important.html content="
   Only perform this step is you have enabled Apache to handle the SSL/TLS encryption for Tomcat and the TDS.
   " %}

   The TDS deployment descriptor (`${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/web.xml`) is configured to only allow access parts of the TDS application via TLS/SSL.  
   Because we've disabled Tomcat's handling of the TLS/SSL, we need to update these configurations.

   Use your favorite editor to open the TDS `${tomcat_home}/webapps/thredds/WEB-INF/web.xml` file.  
   Around line `106` you'll start seeing configurations that look like the following:
    
   ~~~xml
   <!-- tdsConfig with HTTPS needed for /admin access  -->
     <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
          <web-resource-name>sensitive read access</web-resource-name>
          <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
          <role-name>tdsConfig</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
        <user-data-constraint>
          <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
        </user-data-constraint>
      </security-constraint>
    ...
   ~~~
   
   These configs restrict access to the url in the `<url-pattern>` tags to the role in the `<role-name>` tags (which correspond to the roles defined in the `${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml` file).  
   The `<transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>` says access must take place via HTTPS.  
   
   For any restricted part of the TDS you want to access that is listed here, you'll need to comment out the configurations in the `<user-data-constraint>` tags:

   ~~~xml
   <!-- tdsConfig with HTTPS needed for /admin access  -->
     <security-constraint>
        <web-resource-collection>
          <web-resource-name>sensitive read access</web-resource-name>
          <url-pattern>/admin/*</url-pattern>
        </web-resource-collection>
        <auth-constraint>
          <role-name>tdsConfig</role-name>
        </auth-constraint>
        <!-- do not use tomcat https
          <user-data-constraint>
            <transport-guarantee>CONFIDENTIAL</transport-guarantee>
          </user-data-constraint>
        -->
      </security-constraint>
    ...
   ~~~
   
   {%include warning.html content="
   If you leave outside access to the TDS and Tomcat open via port `8080` this once protected portion of the TDS is now open in the clear. 
   Hence, we recommend disabling these connectors if you are using Apache as a proxy.  
   
   Also, keep these changes to the configurations in mind if you ever decide to reverse or undo the Apache reverse proxy!
   " %}
   
## Changing The TDS Context Path (`/thredds`)
 
We **do not recommend** changing the TDS context path (the `/thredds` part of the URL path). 
However, if your network configuration requires that you use a different context path (e.g., `/my/thredds`) or you are proxying two TDS installations and need to differentiate them with different context paths (e.g., `/thredds1` and `/thredds2` ), you will need to make the following changes:

1. Rename the `thredds.war` file to match the desired context path before you deploy it to Tomcat.
   Tomcat and other servlet engines direct incoming requests to a particular web application when the beginning of the request URL path matches the context path of that particular webapp.
   The easiest way to let Tomcat (or any other servlet engine) know what context path to use for a given webapp is to rename that webapp's `.war` file before deploying it to Tomcat.

   For instance, if you want all URLs starting with `/thredds2` to be handled by your TDS install, rename the `thredds.war` file to `thredds2.war` before you deploy it to Tomcat.

   If the desired context path is a multi-level context path (e.g., `/my/thredds` ), you must use a pound sign ("#") in the `.war` filename to encode the slash (`/`).
   In this case, the `thredds.war` file would need to be renamed to `my#thredds.war`.

   {%include important.html content="
     The deployment descriptor (`web.xml` file) is overwritten during deployment which means this edit must be done every time the TDS is re-deployed.
   " %}

2. Edit the TDS `web.xml` file and change the value of the `ContextPath` parameter to match the desired context path.

   The TDS uses the value of the `ContextPath` context parameter (as defined in the TDS `web.xml` file) when generating TDS URLs in certain situations.
   To make sure all generated URLs are consistent, you must change the value of the `ContextPath` parameter to match the desired context path.

   (Changing the value of `ContextPath` will no longer be necessary in a future release once we require Tomcat 6.0 (Servlet 2.5).

   The TDS `web.xml` file is located in `${tomcat_home}/webapps/<contextPath>/WEB-INF/web.xml`, where `<contextPath>` is the value of the desired context path.
   The `ContextPath` context parameter is defined in the `web.xml` file (starting at line `12`):

   ~~~xml
   <context-param>
     <param-name>ContextPath</param-name>
     <param-value>thredds</param-value>
   </context-param>
   ~~~

   For the `/thredds2` example, it should be changed to:

   ~~~xml
   <context-param>
     <param-name>ContextPath</param-name>
     <param-value>thredds2</param-value>
   </context-param>
   ~~~

   And for the `/my/thredds` example, it should be changed to:
   ~~~xml
   <context-param>
     <param-name>ContextPath</param-name>
     <param-value>my/thredds</param-value>
   </context-param>
   ~~~

3. Edit your TDS configuration catalogs and change the service base URLs to start with the desired context path.
 
   So that users will receive the correct data access URLs for datasets served by your TDS, the base URLs given by the `service` elements in your TDS configuration catalogs must match the desired context path.

   An OPeNDAP service element on a TDS with the context path of `/thredds2` would need to look similar to this:

   ~~~xml
   <service name="odap" serviceType="OPeNDAP" base="/thredds2/dodsC/"/>
   ~~~

   And, similarly, an OPeNDAP `service` element on a TDS with the context path of `/my/thredds` would need to look similar to this:

   ~~~xml
   <service name="odap" serviceType="OPeNDAP" base="/my/thredds/dodsC/"/>
   ~~~

## Troubleshooting Tips

* Check the catalog URL in the title of the HTML view of catalogs matches the requested URL.
* Check the Data Access URL in the OPeNDAP Data Access Form matches the requested URL (minus the `.html` suffix).
* If you have [TDS Remote Management](remote_management_ref.html)
 configured, go to the TDS debug page (e.g., [http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug](http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug){:target="_blank"}) and follow the "Show HTTP Request info" link.
* Once there, check the values listed for server name and port and the context path all match the appropriate values from the request URL, e.g., for the URL [http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug?General/showRequest](http://localhost:8080/thredds/admin/debug?General/showRequest){:target="_blank"} , the values should be:

   ~~~bash
   req.getServerName(): localhost
   req.getServerPort(): 8080
   req.getContextPath(): /thredds
   ~~~

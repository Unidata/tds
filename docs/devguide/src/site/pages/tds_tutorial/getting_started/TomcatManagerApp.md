This section examines the Tomcat Manager Application and demonstrates how to grant ourselves access to it in preparation for accessing restricted parts of the TDS.

{%include note.html content="
This section assumes you have successfully installed the JDK and Tomcat Servlet Container as outlined in the [Installation of Java and Tomcat](install_java_tomcat.html) section.
" %}

## About The Manager Application

* "Free" web application that comes with Tomcat distribution.
* Lives in the `${tomcat_home}/webapps/manager` directory.
* Allows Tomcat administrators to deploy, un-deploy, or reload web applications such as the TDS without having to shut down and restart Tomcat. 
* Provides server status statistics for the JVM and each connector you have configured in `${tomcat_home}/conf/server.xml`.

{%include note.html content=
"For more information about the Tomcat manager application, see the [Tomcat Manager App HOW-TO](https://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/manager-howto.html){:target='_blank'} documentation.

## Accessing The Manager Application

Attempt to access the Tomcat `manager` application in your browser by visiting [http://localhost:8080/manager/html/](http://localhost:8080/manager/html/){:target="_blank"}.

You will be prompted to login via BASIC authentication, which will end in failure since we do not yet have permission to access the `manager` application:

{%include question.html content="
Based on what we know about Tomcat configuration, which file in the `${tomcat_home}/conf` directory should we edit to grant ourselves access to the `manager` application?
" %}

## Granting Access To The Manager Application

**By default, the Tomcat Manager application is disabled** in an effort to prevent unintended exploitation.  
In order to use the Manager application you must change Tomcat configurations to enable it.

This will be done in the following 2 steps:

#### I. Create a context configuration file for the manager application

   Use your favorite text editor to create a new file called `manager.xml` in the `${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost`: 

   ~~~bash
   # cd ${tomcat_home}/conf/Catalina/localhost
   # vi manager.xml
   ~~~

   Add the following information to you `manager.xml` file and save it:

   ~~~bash
   <Context privileged="true" antiResourceLocking="false" docBase="${catalina.home}/webapps/manager"/>
   ~~~

   {%include note.html content="  
   For more information about web application context configuration files and their security options, please review the [Tomcat Manager App How-To](http://tomcat.apache.org/tomcat-8.5-doc/manager-howto.html#Introduction){:target='_blank'} documentation.
   " %} 


#### II. Modify `tomcat-users.xml`

{%include ahead.html content="
To gain access to restricted parts of the TDS, you will perform the same steps you used to grant yourself access to the Tomcat Manager application.
" %}

1. Modify `tomcat-users.xml` to add `role` and `user` elements.

   Use your favorite editor to open `${tomcat_home}/conf/tomcat-users.xml`:

   ~~~bash
   # vi tomcat-users.xml
   ~~~
   
   You should see something like this:
   
   ~~~bash
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

   <tomcat-users xmlns="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml"

                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd"
                 version="1.0">
   <!--
     NOTE:  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
     to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
     you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary. It is
     strongly recommended that you do NOT use one of the users in the commented out
     section below since they are intended for use with the examples web
     application.
   -->
   <!--
     NOTE:  The sample user and role entries below are intended for use with the
     examples web application. They are wrapped in a comment and thus are ignored
     when reading this file. If you wish to configure these users for use with the
     examples web application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds
     them. You will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
   -->
   <!--
     <role rolename="tomcat"/>
     <role rolename="role1"/>
     <user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>
     <user username="both" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
     <user username="role1" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="role1"/>
   -->
   </tomcat-users>
   ~~~

   The `role` and `user` elements are commented out.  Why?
     
   {%include warning.html content="  
   Think of the security implications of enabling this web application and making it available to anyone to access/use if he knows the URL. Someone with less than good intentions could learn about server environment and un-deploy/deploy any application using the Manager application.   
   " %} 
   

2. Between the `<tomcat-users>` tags, un-comment the `role` and `user` tags.  
   Add a `role` element and specify the `rolename` attribute as `manager-gui` and delete any un-used roles: 

   ~~~xml
   <tomcat-users xmlns="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd"
                 version="1.0">
   <!--
     NOTE:  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
     to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
     you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary. It is
     strongly recommended that you do NOT use one of the users in the commented out
     section below since they are intended for use with the examples web
     application.
   -->
   <!--
     NOTE:  The sample user and role entries below are intended for use with the
     examples web application. They are wrapped in a comment and thus are ignored
     when reading this file. If you wish to configure these users for use with the
     examples web application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds
     them. You will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
   -->
     <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
     <user username="tomcat" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat"/>
     <user username="both" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="tomcat,role1"/>
     <user username="role1" password="<must-be-changed>" roles="role1"/>
   </tomcat-users>

   ~~~

3. Add a new user by adding a user element.
   Create a username and password for the new user and specify `manager-gui` as one of the roles and delete any un-used users.
   
   In this example we are creating a user called *admin* with a corresponding password of *supersecretpassword*:

   ~~~xml
   <tomcat-users xmlns="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml"
                 xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
                 xsi:schemaLocation="http://tomcat.apache.org/xml tomcat-users.xsd"
                 version="1.0">
   <!--
     NOTE:  By default, no user is included in the "manager-gui" role required
     to operate the "/manager/html" web application.  If you wish to use this app,
     you must define such a user - the username and password are arbitrary. It is
     strongly recommended that you do NOT use one of the users in the commented out
     section below since they are intended for use with the examples web
     application.
   -->
   <!--
     NOTE:  The sample user and role entries below are intended for use with the
     examples web application. They are wrapped in a comment and thus are ignored
     when reading this file. If you wish to configure these users for use with the
     examples web application, do not forget to remove the <!.. ..> that surrounds
     them. You will also need to set the passwords to something appropriate.
   -->
     <role rolename="manager-gui"/>
     <user username="admin" password="supersecretpassword" roles="manager-gui"/>
   </tomcat-users>
   ~~~

    {%include important.html content="
    Keep in mind: Changes to `tomcat-users.xml` do not take effect until Tomcat is restarted.
    " %}


4. Restart Tomcat and log into the manager application.
   
   Attempt to access the manager application again [http://localhost:8080/manager/html/](http://localhost:8080/manager/html/){:target="_blank"}, this time logging in using the user name and password specified in `tomcat-users.xml`:

   {% include image.html file="tds/tutorial/getting_started/manager.png" alt="Tomcat manager application" caption="" %}

   Voil&aacute;! You should have access to the manager application.

   {%include troubleshooting.html content="
   Check the XML syntax in `tomcat-users.xml` to make sure it is well-formed and without error.
   " %}
   {%include troubleshooting.html content="
   Did you restart Tomcat after you made your changes to `tomcat-users.xml`?
   " %}
   {%include troubleshooting.html content="
   Any errors will be reported in the `${tomcat_home}/logs/catalina.out` file.
   " %}
   
## Deploying The TDS Using The Manager Application

Take the Manager application for a test-drive to un-deploy and re-deploy the TDS.

1. Use the Tomcat Manager application to un-deploy the TDS.

   Find the TDS in the list of web application on the _Applications_ page.
   `Stop` and then `Undeploy` the TDS:

   {% include image.html file="tds/tutorial/getting_started/undeploy.png" alt="Undeploy the TDS" caption="" %}

   List the contents of the `${tomcat_home}/webapps` directory to verify that both `thredds.war` and the unpacked `thredds/` directory have been removed:

   ~~~bash
   # cd /usr/local/tomcat/webapps
   # ls -l
   total 20
   drwxr-x--- 14 root root     4096 Oct 24 13:29 docs
   drwxr-x---  6 root root     4096 Oct 24 13:29 examples
   drwxr-x---  5 root root     4096 Oct 24 13:29 host-manager
   drwxr-x---  5 root root     4096 Oct 24 13:29 manager
   drwxr-x---  3 root root     4096 Oct 24 13:29 ROOT
   ~~~

2. Deploy the TDS using the Manager application.

   Upload the TDS WAR file using the _Deploy_ section of the Manager application:

   {% include image.html file="tds/tutorial/getting_started/deploy.png" alt="Deploy the TDS" caption="" %}

   Confirm the deployment went as planned by accessing the TDS using your browser:[http://localhost:8080/thredds/](http://localhost:8080/thredds/){:target="_blank"} 


{%include note.html content="
Running an older version of Tomcat?  
The manager application URLs and roles have been re-structured.
See the [Tomcat Migration Guide](http://tomcat.apache.org/migration.html){:target='_blank'} for more information.
" %}


## Next Step

If you plan to deploy the TDS in a production environment you will need to follow the best practices outlined in the [Putting TDS Into Production](tomcat_permissions.html) section of the tutorial to finish hardening your server environment.

{%include ahead.html content="
[TLS/SSL Encryption](enable_tls_encryption.html) will need to be enabled in order to access a couple of TDS monitoring and debugging tools.

The [Basic TDS Configuration](basic_config_catalog.html) and [TDS Configuration Catalogs](config_catalog.html) sections of this tutorial cover the TDS configuration files, configuration options and TDS catalog structure.
